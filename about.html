            AC/DC (stylized as ACÏŸDC) are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by Scottish-born brothers
            Malcolm and Angus Young.[1] Although their music has been variously described as hard rock, blues rock, and
            heavy metal,[2] the band themselves call it simply "rock and roll".[3]

            AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, 1975's High Voltage. Membership
            subsequently stabilised around the Young brothers, singer Bon Scott, drummer Phil Rudd, and bassist Mark
            Evans. Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced by Cliff Williams, who has appeared on every AC/DC
            album since 1978's Powerage. In February 1980, Scott died of acute alcohol poisoning after a night of heavy
            drinking.[4] The group considered disbanding but elected to stay together, bringing in longtime Geordie
            vocalist Brian Johnson as Scott's replacement.[5] Later that year, the band released their first album with
            Johnson, Back in Black, which was dedicated to Scott's memory. The album launched AC/DC to new heights of
            success and became one of the best selling albums of all time.

            The band's eighth studio album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You (1981), was their first album to reach
            number one in the United States. Prior the release of 1983's Flick of the Switch, drummer Rudd left the band
            and was replaced by Simon Wright, being in turn replaced by Chris Slade in 1989. The band experienced a
            commercial resurgence in the early nineties with the release of 1990's The Razors Edge. Rudd returned to the
            band in 1994, replacing Slade and appearing on the band's next four albums. Their fifteenth studio album
            Black Ice was the second-highest-selling album of 2008, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to
            Rock, eventually reaching No.1 worldwide.[6]

            AC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 71.5 million albums in the United States,
            making them the tenth highest-selling artist in the United States and the 14th best selling artist
            worldwide.[7][8][9] Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the third
            highest-selling album by any artist, and the highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22
            million units in the US, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time.[10] AC/DC ranked fourth on
            VH1's list of the "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"[11][12] and were named the seventh "Greatest Heavy
            Metal Band of All Time" by MTV.[13] In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the "100
            Greatest Artists of All Time". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone
            list, referred to AC/DC as "the greatest rock and roll band of all time".[14] In 2010, VH1 ranked AC/DC
            number 23 in its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".[15]

            In November 1973, Malcolm and Angus Young formed AC/DC with bassist Larry Van Kriedt, vocalist Dave Evans,
            and ex-Masters Apprentices drummer Colin Burgess.[25] Gene Pierson booked the band to play at Chequers
            nightclub on New Year's Eve, 1973.[26] By this time, Angus Young had adopted his characteristic
            school-uniform stage outfit. The idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes: Spider-Man,
            Zorro, a gorilla, and a parody of Superman, named Super-Ang.[19] In its early days, most members of the band
            dressed in some form of glam or satin outfit. On stage, Evans was occasionally replaced by the band's first
            manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet. In Paul Stenning's book AC/DC: Two
            Sides To Every Glory it was stated that Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which also contributed to the
            band's bitter feeling toward Evans.[27]

            By the middle of 1974, the band had built up a strong live reputation, which led to a support slot for the
            visiting Lou Reed. Sometime in 1974, on the recommendation of Michael Chugg, veteran Melbourne promoter
            Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club, the Hard Rock. He was not pleased with their glam rock
            image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar
            playing. Shortly afterward, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they were
            stuck in Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the
            Hard Rock. Following the gig, they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of
            their older brother George and Harry Vanda.[28] The Young brothers decided to abandon the glam rock image
            which had already been adopted by Melbourne band The Skyhooks and pursue a harder blues-rock sound. To this
            end, they agreed that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group.[27] Around this time, they also moved
            their base to Melbourne, where they frequently played at the Hard Rock.
