        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
            AC/DC (stylized as ACÏŸDC) are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by Scottish-born brothers
            Malcolm and Angus Young.[1] Although their music has been variously described as hard rock, blues rock, and
            heavy metal,[2] the band themselves call it simply "rock and roll".[3]

            AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, 1975's High Voltage. Membership
            subsequently stabilised around the Young brothers, singer Bon Scott, drummer Phil Rudd, and bassist Mark
            Evans. Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced by Cliff Williams, who has appeared on every AC/DC
            album since 1978's Powerage. In February 1980, Scott died of acute alcohol poisoning after a night of heavy
            drinking.[4] The group considered disbanding but elected to stay together, bringing in longtime Geordie
            vocalist Brian Johnson as Scott's replacement.[5] Later that year, the band released their first album with
            Johnson, Back in Black, which was dedicated to Scott's memory. The album launched AC/DC to new heights of
            success and became one of the best selling albums of all time.

            The band's eighth studio album, For Those About to Rock We Salute You (1981), was their first album to reach
            number one in the United States. Prior the release of 1983's Flick of the Switch, drummer Rudd left the band
            and was replaced by Simon Wright, being in turn replaced by Chris Slade in 1989. The band experienced a
            commercial resurgence in the early nineties with the release of 1990's The Razors Edge. Rudd returned to the
            band in 1994, replacing Slade and appearing on the band's next four albums. Their fifteenth studio album
            Black Ice was the second-highest-selling album of 2008, and their biggest chart hit since For Those About to
            Rock, eventually reaching No.1 worldwide.[6]

            Greatest Artists of All Time". Producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone
            list, referred to AC/DC as "the greatest rock and roll band of all time".[14] In 2010, VH1 ranked AC/DC
            number 23 in its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".[15]
